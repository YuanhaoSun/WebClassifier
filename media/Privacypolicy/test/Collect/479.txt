Adobe has established relationships with various providers of services and products who are not part of Adobe and who may not themselves be providing products and services to Adobe or on Adobe's behalf ("Providers").  Providers do not include third parties contracted by Adobe to perform services on Adobe's behalf. The services of these Providers may be available to you from the Site, from websites that are linked to the Site, or in connection with the Products and Services. Typically, these Providers offer services that Adobe customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with Products and Services. In order to use Providers' products and services, you may be required to provide personal information to the Providers or agree to allow Adobe to share your personal information with such Providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a Provider's website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on that site, and personal information that you provide while on the Site will be subject to this Privacy Policy
