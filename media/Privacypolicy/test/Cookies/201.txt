Blizzard and our third-party tracking service also employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user¡¯s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. These clear gifs are not tied to personally identifiable information
