We may update this policy if we materially change our practices or if legal or regulatory changes require it. If we decide to use or disclose personal information in a way that is materially different from that which was stated in this policy at the time the personal information was collected, we will notify you by posting notice of the change on our Web site's home page for at least 30 days before we implement that change and will give you an opportunity to opt-out of the proposed use or disclosure of previously collected personal information. You should refer to this policy often for the latest information and the effective date of any changes
