When you access our Online Services, we automatically collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to our Online Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, potentially including your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access our Online Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device ("UDID") or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. We may use these technologies to facilitate our login processes; personalize your experience on WSJDN Services; display relevant content, products, services and advertising, as described further below; and collect and store information about your usage of our Online Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen. We may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our Online Services to Personal Information obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or clickstream data about your activities on our Online Services may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences
