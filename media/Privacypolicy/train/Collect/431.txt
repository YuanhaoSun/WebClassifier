When your computer contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit this website, view an HTML e-mail, or download an interactive desktop from the website), our web servers automatically collect website usage information. Website usage information is non-identifying information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our website. It can include the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our website, and IP addresses (see below for more information on IP addresses). We also may determine the applicable technology available in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page, e-mail or similar service
