Like most web-based services, Ning automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser when you use the Ning Platform. We may use a variety of methods, including clear GIFs (also known as ¡°web beacons¡±), and ¡°cookies¡± to collect this information. The information that we collect with these automated methods may include, for example, your IP address, Ning cookie information, a unique device or user ID, browser type, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Ning Platform, and the ¡°referring URL¡± (i.e., the page from which you navigated to the Ning Platform).
