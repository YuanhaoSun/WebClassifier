Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites or SPE content, SPE, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Sites are accessed and used ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page views. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if SPE associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, SPE treats it as Personal Information
