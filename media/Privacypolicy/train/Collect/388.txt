In order to become a User, you must provide us the following information to create an account: name, email address, country, and password. Without this minimal amount of information, you cannot create a LinkedIn account. Like other passwords, you should choose one that is known only by you. LinkedIn requests other information from you during the registration process, (e.g., gender, location, etc.) that LinkedIn uses to provide better, more customized services such as language-specific profile pages and updates, better ads, and more valuable career opportunities. You acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and by creating an account on LinkedIn, you allow others, including LinkedIn, to identify you and to allow LI to use your information in accordance with our User Agreement
