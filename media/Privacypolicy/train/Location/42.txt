We need to know approximately where you are so that we can deliver mobile phone services to you. Location information (such as your latitude and longitude) is relayed to us and some of our partners when your phone is turned  on or when you use the services. This information will also be shared with the emergency services so that when you  make an emergency call, the emergency services are able to respond more quickly to the call. Location information cannot usually be used to pinpoint exactly where you are. For example, it cannot usually be used to determine which particular house or shop you are in at a given time. Instead it offers an approximate location based on your position relative to the nearest mobile phone masts. The accuracy of this information depends on how close you are to a mobile phone mast and is likely to be more accurate in urban areas compared to rural areas.
