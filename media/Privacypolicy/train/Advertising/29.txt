You may see third-party advertisements on some T-Mobile Web sites, deck pages, services, or devices. These third-party advertisers, or their ad networks, may place or access cookies on your device and may collect certain anonymous information about your visit on our sites. The third-party advertisers who provide these ads may use this information to provide you with advertising on our Web sites and deck pages, as well as on other sites. This advertising may be tailored to the interests the advertisers have inferred from your browsing of our Web sites or other Web sites with which the third-party is affiliated as an ad server or ad network. We do not provide personal information about you directly to the advertiser. We may, however, provide third-party advertisers with anonymous demographic or similar data (unrelated to your browsing activities) that does not personally identify you. This data may be used by them to help tailor their ads on our sites or deck pages, and on other sites.
