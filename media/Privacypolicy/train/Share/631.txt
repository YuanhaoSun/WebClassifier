The Service supports and may encourage interaction among players. In most Zynga games your SNS friends will see your name, profile photo and descriptions of your game activity. In many Zynga games friends and other players will be able to see your game profile, which may include your name or a ¡°game name¡± and your profile photo, which in certain cases can reveal your SNS User ID number or Zynga ID. For example, in Zynga Poker any other player may encounter your game profile, if you are playing at the same table. Access to a Zynga ID or your SNS User ID may allow others to view the public information associated with your related SNS or Zynga account. Other players may also be able to send you game requests or even friend requests through the related SNS¡¯ communication channels
