In some cases, access to certain products and services, such as content subscription products or products distributed by third parties, may require the provision of personal information to a third party, such as a content provider or distributor.  In such cases, this will be stated during the registration process, in the terms of use, through the distribution process, or in a similar manner.  The third party's use of such information is governed by that party's privacy policy, and RealNetworks' use is governed by this privacy policy.  Please visit the privacy policy of the content partner to make sure you understand how they use the personal information you provide to them. If you do not wish for such a transfer to take place, you should not register for the applicable product or service.  Additionally, RealNetworks may be required to provide specific access and usage information to certain content providers and rights holders as a condition of content licensing and royalties.  In such cases, RealNetworks may provide content usage, access, demographic and other information without your personally identifiable information (your name, billing information, email address) to the content provider
