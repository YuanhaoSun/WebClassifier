Like most websites, we use cookies and web log files to track site usage and trends, to improve the quality of our service, to customize your experience on LinkedIn, as well as to deliver LinkedIn and third-party advertising to Users both on and off the LinkedIn site. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us to recognize you as a User when you return to the LinkedIn website using the same computer and web browser.  One type of cookie, known as a ¡°persistent¡± cookie, is set once you¡¯ve logged in to your LinkedIn account. The next time you visit the LinkedIn website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the Services. In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number) or to send a message to another User, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Another type of cookie, called a ¡°session¡± cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the LinkedIn websit
