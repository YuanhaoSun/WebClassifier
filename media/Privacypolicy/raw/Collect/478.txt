We receive information when you use your LinkedIn account to log in or authenticate to a third-party website or application. Also, if you are logged into LinkedIn and visit a third party site that embeds LinkedIn professional plugins, like ¡°Share on LinkedIn¡± for web publishers, LinkedIn will receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser. LinkedIn will use this information to personalize the LinkedIn-provided functionality, including providing you insights from your LinkedIn network, allowing you to share information with your network, enabling you to use LinkedIn functionality off the LinkedIn site and serving you more relevant advertising. Users wishing to disable this personalization may opt-out of this feature as of August 2011. LinkedIn¡¯s retention of this data is addressed in Section 1.K.
