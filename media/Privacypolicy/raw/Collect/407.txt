Profile Content consists of information a user may add to the user's profile on the FOX Services. For example, for the FOX Websites' community profile, it includes a user's information such as "Status" and "About Me", and content such as photos, as well as the user's blog, friends, comments and other similar information. You may also be able to set up a profile in connection with another FOX Service, for example, an application, game or reward program
